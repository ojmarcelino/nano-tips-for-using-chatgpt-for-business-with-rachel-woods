00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,175
Have you ever used ChatGPT and found that the output

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:04,350
was very inaccurate?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,510
Let's talk about why that happens.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,153
ChatGPT is a powerful AI model, but at its, core all it's doing is

5
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:13,398
learning patterns from words and using that to predict the

6
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:14,650
next most likely word.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,967
This allows it to generate text that sounds coherent

8
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,877
and confident,

9
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:21,738
but that doesn't always mean that it's accurate.

10
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,80
This is known as the hallucination problem,

11
00:00:24,80 --> 00:00:27,09
when the generated text doesn't match the underlying data

12
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:27,950
that it was given.

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,929
For example, ChatGPT can make up non existent biographies of

14
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,303
fake famous people.

15
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:36,180
It can give historical context on fake events,

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,867
and it can even provide pretty compelling logic that's not

17
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,678
actually conceptually sound.

18
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,428
To reduce this, you can write better prompts or

19
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:47,896
provide additional context or data for the AI model to use.

20
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,291
However, it's still not foolproof, and that's why you should always

21
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,274
review the output coming out of these models to ensure that

22
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:55,00
they are accurate.
