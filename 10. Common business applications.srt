00:00:00,60 --> 00:00:02,430
How are people using AI in their day to day work?

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,678
First, I like to think of AI almost like you're delegating work

3
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:08,140
to an intern or someone that's new on your team.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,202
I think it's a good analogy because, just like you'd have to

5
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:14,00
give that person context, you're going to need to give

6
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:15,214
the AI context as well.

7
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,61
And by thinking about it as delegating,

8
00:00:17,61 --> 00:00:20,516
you can reflect on what are the things that you love to do and how

9
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:23,120
could you delegate the mundane work that you don't

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,24
like doing to AI?

11
00:00:24,24 --> 00:00:27,534
We are seeing AI be applied across almost every domain,

12
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,443
but some of the most mature ones are AI in marketing,

13
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,364
customer support, sales and even software

14
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:34,240
development.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,139
Within marketing, you can use AI to help you create

16
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:41,23
marketing materials such as emails and social media posts and sales.

17
00:00:41,23 --> 00:00:43,560
AI can help you generate personalized outreach,

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,688
research your customer and even summarize meeting notes from a

19
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:48,404
sales call. In internal operations,

20
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:51,887
people are using AI to create the first draft of project plans,

21
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,683
drafting proposals and even drafting slide decks for

22
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:57,644
presentations. In software engineering AI is even helping

23
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:00,56
people write code in a fraction of the time.

24
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:03,495
There's no shortage of ways to use AI across every domain.

25
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:06,669
The best place to start is just to try a bunch of tools and see how

26
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:08,00
AI could help you in your work.
