If you want to customize ChatGPT further for your use cases,

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,970
there are a few approaches that you can take.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,375
One approach you can do is something called fine-tuning,

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,168
where you basically give ChatGPT a large data set of example inputs

5
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:17,888
and example outputs for a given task, and that teaches the AI model

6
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:19,703
how to perform your task.

7
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:23,210
Another approach is to bring in outside context or data into

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,339
your prompt itself.

9
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,373
You could pull in data such as your company's support documents,

10
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:29,820
internal wikis or any type of database,

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,515
so that when you're asked a question,

12
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,821
you can look up the most relevant information in that outside data

13
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:39,729
set and then pull in the most relevant context to provide as

14
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,710
support to ChatGPT as it generates the answer.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,825
There are a growing number of products and providers that are

16
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:48,05
helping people do both of these approaches.

17
00:00:48,05 --> 00:00:51,827
Or your engineering team can use OpenAI's documentation to develop

18
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:53,767
an internal version for yourself.

19
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,681
But if you thought that ChatGPT was powerful as is,

20
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,00
wait until you customize it for your data.
