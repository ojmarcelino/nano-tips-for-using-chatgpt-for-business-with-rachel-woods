00:00:00,90 --> 00:00:03,452
Writing a good prompt helps us get the most out of AI tools

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:04,205
like ChatGPT.

3
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:07,510
Prompting is a way to give these AI models direction so it can

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,110
understand our task and then help us complete it.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,743
But to get the best results, you need to know how to

6
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:13,776
craft a good prompt.

7
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:16,293
And most people who struggle with prompting are making

8
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:17,100
the same mistake.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,613
They're being too generic and expecting that AI is just

10
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:20,730
going to read our minds.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,419
For example, if you ask something generic like write a social media

12
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:27,214
caption for a bakery, you're going to get something

13
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:28,220
generic in return.

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,635
So what makes a good prompt?

15
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:32,798
Well, first, you need to create context. Before you ask the

16
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,904
AI model to do something, you need to help it understand

17
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:36,412
the task.

18
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,591
One best practice is to tell the AI what you want it

19
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,526
to act as,

20
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:44,181
such as a social media marketer, which helps roleplay and have

21
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,854
more context for your task.

22
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:49,874
Second, you want to be specific and give the AI a more concrete

23
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:50,717
task at hand.

24
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,447
Like you will be responsible for writing engaging social media

25
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:57,321
captions for Instagram feed, for our bakery.

26
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,51
You write in our brand voice, which is friendly,

27
00:01:00,51 --> 00:01:01,110
casual and witty.

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,956
Then you want to give clear instructions for what you

29
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:04,887
expect in return.

30
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:08,212
For example, saying, my first request is I need a

31
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:10,705
caption for a blue boy birthday cake.

32
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:14,992
Finally, be as simple and concise with your language as possible.

33
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,128
And if you find yourself getting wordy,

34
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,52
you can even ask the AI model to rewrite your prompt

35
00:01:20,52 --> 00:01:21,120
to be more concise.

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,193
Keep these tips in mind and you're going to be able to get the most

37
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:25,00
out of AI models like ChatGPT.
