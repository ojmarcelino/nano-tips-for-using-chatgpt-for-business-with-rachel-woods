00:00:00,90 --> 00:00:03,75
AI tools like ChatGPT are incredibly powerful,

2
00:00:03,75 --> 00:00:06,276
but it's important to keep people involved in the process.

3
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:09,510
In this video, I'll explain why. AI models are impressive,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,94
but they are far from perfect.

5
00:00:11,94 --> 00:00:12,570
If you've ever used ChatGPT,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,438
you've seen that the outputs of these tools can be questionable,

7
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:19,131
and that's true for other tools like DALL-E,

8
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:20,700
Midjourney and more.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,330
That's why it's important to keep a human involved in the process to

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,93
provide oversight and make sure that the results are

11
00:00:27,93 --> 00:00:27,960
of high quality.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,956
This is especially important in high stakes domains such as code

13
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:35,190
generation or showing the output to an end customer.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,327
For example, I would not recommend setting up an automated email

15
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:43,267
response where you have GPT generating the results unless you

16
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,747
are certain that it is very good and does not generate

17
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,60
any weird responses.

18
00:00:48,60 --> 00:00:51,605
I think it's much better to think about the results out of these AI

19
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,989
models as a first draft and then you should review and edit that

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,729
output to get it to the quality level that you want.

21
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,66
If you aren't going to review every single response,

22
00:01:01,66 --> 00:01:03,762
at a minimum, you should be reviewing results on

23
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:04,680
a regular basis.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,128
And one last tip is that you should keep track of what the AI

25
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:11,117
model generated versus what's your final result after

26
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,94
you've edited it.

27
00:01:12,94 --> 00:01:16,937
This can provide good context of how well is the AI model doing at

28
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:19,00
the first pass draft of your task.
