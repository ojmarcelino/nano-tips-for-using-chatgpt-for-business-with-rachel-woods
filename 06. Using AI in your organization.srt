00:00:00,90 --> 00:00:03,390
Here are three easy steps to start using AI in your business.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,563
The first is to develop AI literacy,

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:09,412
which is an understanding of what is AI and how can it be used.

4
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:13,301
For example, today AI can be used to create content,

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:17,558
summarize, synthesize, predict, classify and a lot more.

6
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:20,587
You also need to understand the limitations of AI so that you can

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,575
make smart decisions about how to apply it.

8
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:25,205
The second step is to get a deeper understanding of the

9
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:26,130
capabilities of AI.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,180
The best way to do this is to start playing with some of the AI

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,401
tools that are launching every day,

12
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:36,517
Focus on learning and having a little bit of fun and then try to

13
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:40,698
find tools across a variety of applications from text to image, to

14
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,160
audio, to video, to data, and whatever else you could find.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,280
The best way to develop AI literacy is just to start trying stuff.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,217
And once you're ready to start putting AI to work for you,

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,206
start by identifying a few internal tasks that

18
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,335
you want to have AI

19
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:56,490
start to help you with.

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,748
While it can be tempting to jump to building a new product or

21
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,648
service for your end customer first,

22
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:05,231
I recommend that you start with an internal use case because you're

23
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,380
going to learn a lot more from having first-hand experience.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,284
I hope that these steps help you get started with AI in your

25
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:12,00
work or organization.
