00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,402
Have you ever wondered how computers are able

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,210
to generate art,

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,928
write stories, and even create music?

4
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:09,854
Well, it's because of a new type of AI technology called

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:10,853
Generative AI.

6
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:14,359
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that's

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,302
able to learn from patterns and data and generate new data based

8
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:19,742
on what it has learned.

9
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:23,804
Today, the most widely used types of Generative AI are models that

10
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:27,491
are generating text or images such as ChatGPT or Midjourney.

11
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:30,71
But these models can be applied across a lot of different

12
00:00:30,71 --> 00:00:30,716
types of data,

13
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:33,933
including audio, video, 3D models,

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,773
and the list is growing every day.

15
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:40,289
And that ability to generate new data has really democratized

16
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,268
access to AI.

17
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:43,750
In the past, to use AI, you would have to train one

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,707
of these models yourself, which would require you to have

19
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:50,140
big data and an experienced team that can go and build that model.

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,687
But now, because these models have learned that core task,

21
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:58,55
such as generating text, they are actually able to be

22
00:00:58,55 --> 00:01:03,264
applied across a whole variety of new tasks, such as summarizing

23
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,104
documents,

24
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:06,975
copywriting, writing code and a lot more.

25
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:08,880
There are a growing number of companies,

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,573
including OpenAI, who are building these models and

27
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,727
then making them available to the public.

28
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:17,657
So, if you've ever wanted to use AI in your business or in your work,

29
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:21,00
there's never been a better time, thanks to Generative AI.
