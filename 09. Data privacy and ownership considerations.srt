1
00:00:00,60 --> 00:00:03,40
What happens to your data when you're using AI models

2
00:00:03,40 --> 00:00:03,785
like ChatGPT?

3
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:06,882
If you're using AI at work or for your business,

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,256
this is an important question to ask and understand.

5
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:13,765
Now, the details of how data is used varies based on the

6
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:14,870
product or model.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,620
And if you have specific questions,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,915
I recommend talking to a lawyer about data ownership and privacy.

9
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:23,745
But, here are three questions which are good to ask and keep in mind.

10
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,691
First is, do you have commercial rights to the output?

11
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,572
For example, if you want to use an image that you've generated

12
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,744
using an AI tool, you'll need to understand the

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,200
licensing that comes with the tool that you're using.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,474
Second is, are your inputs and outputs being used to improve

15
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,242
the underlying AI model?

16
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:43,966
This is very common for tech products and it was the reason why

17
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,149
ChatGPT was launched and given for free to the public.

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,565
They specifically call this a research preview

19
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,82
for those purposes. You can learn about how this works

20
00:00:52,82 --> 00:00:54,885
for any product that you're using, usually by looking at the

21
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:55,692
terms of service.

22
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:59,790
Third is, what data am I sharing in order to use the service?

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,985
Many of the AI products today help us with productivity,

24
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:05,322
and so they usually need access to some of our tools,

25
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,504
such as our email or our Google Drive and other sensitive

26
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,186
information.

27
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:12,498
You should understand and only give access to the companies and

28
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:13,780
products that you trust.

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,439
And last, I recommend having an open conversation about this with

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,42
your work or business, because these are very important questions

31
00:01:21,42 --> 00:01:24,129
to have in mind as you're trying to use AI in your work

32
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,00
or day to day.
