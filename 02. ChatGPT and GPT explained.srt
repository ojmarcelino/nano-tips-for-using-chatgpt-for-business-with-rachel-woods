00:00:00,30 --> 00:00:03,622
I'm going to explain the basics of how ChatGPT works so that you can

2
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:06,838
be more informed and get the most out of this new technology.

3
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:11,87
ChatGPT is an application built on top of an AI model called GPT.

4
00:00:11,87 --> 00:00:15,792
GPT is a massive AI model that was trained on billions of words

5
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:19,510
across a bunch of books, a lot of the internet and

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,952
a lot of Wikipedia.

7
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:24,668
GPT works by taking input, text and using what its learned

8
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,993
about language to predict the next most likely word.

9
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:30,965
Once it has that word, it does the same process again to

10
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,803
predict the next most likely word.

11
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:36,382
At its core, all GPT is doing is predicting the next

12
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:37,575
most likely word,

13
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:39,620
given the preceding words.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,745
And one of the most exciting things about GPT is because it's

15
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,426
learned to predict words so effectively,

16
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:49,245
it's able to perform a lot of other tasks.

17
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:53,598
It can be customized and even fine tuned to get better at specific

18
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,870
tasks or use cases.

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,83
And ChatGPT is a great example of this.

20
00:00:58,83 --> 00:01:02,476
OpenAI fine tuned GPT to be better at chat by feeding it a bunch of

21
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,00
examples of chat conversations.
